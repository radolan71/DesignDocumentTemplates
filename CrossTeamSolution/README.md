## Attribution Data Management Solutions Comparison

Based on the research the possible solutions have been compared considering the quality attributes.

| | _0 to 3_ | Maintainability | Testability | Complexity\* | Collaboration | TOTAL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solution 1 | A | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **11** |
| Solution 2 | B | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **11** |
| Solution 3 | C | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 10 |
| Solution 4 | D | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | **11** |
| Solution 5 | E | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 10 |
| Solution 6 | F | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 9 |

\* higher values mean lower complexity.

From the comparison in the previous section 2 solutions seems more suitable f, however Solution 2 offers a less coupled system with less dependencies which is more in line with software engineering best practices.
